Here are scripts for applying Random Forest on plot-level soil heterotrophic respiration. 

(1 training random forest with potential explanatory variables (quantile regression forest)

(2 leave-one-out cross validation to assess the performance of 

(3 applying the trained RF model on gridded explanatory variables
